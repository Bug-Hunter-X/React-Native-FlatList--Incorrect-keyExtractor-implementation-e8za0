In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList components, a common but subtle error arises when the keyExtractor prop is incorrectly implemented or missing.  This can lead to unexpected rendering behavior, performance issues, and even crashes. For instance, using the index as a key is problematic because it can lead to inconsistent UI updates if items are inserted or removed from the list, because keys should be unique and stable. 
```javascript
// Incorrect usage:
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index} // Incorrect: index is not a reliable key
/>
```
